 "description" : "Folds the 'hunting' monster loot pools into the non-hunting pools, so that hunting items like bows are superfluous.  Technically the hunting-specific drop rates are a little worse than if you were using hunting weapons, but they will continue to drop from the non-hunting pools as well.  Additionally, action figure drops have been buffed slightly (at least for the creatures this mod touches).",
